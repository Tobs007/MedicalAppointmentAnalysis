# MedicalAppointmentAnalysis

## Dataset

* In this project, I investigated a medical appointments dataset to investigate the factor responsible for the attendance rate of patients. This data was collected from data of over 110k patients who had medical appointments in Brazil. The dataset contains their medical history, appointment schedule, and attendance status for the appointment. The major question I focused my investigation on is: Which factor(s) amongst the attributes in the dataset makes the patients miss their medical appointment?

* The dataset has 110,527 rows and 14 columns. Dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)

## Summary of Finding
Based on the investigation conducted, most of the patients attended their medical appointment. The following is the summary conclusion deduced for each answer asked in the introduction.

* Gender was not a major determinant of patient's appointment rate.
* SMS receipt status did not determine patients appointment rate, the attendance rate of patients who did not receive SMS was also noticeably higher than that of those that received SMS.
* Hypertension Status did not determine patients appointment rate.
* Diabetes Status did not determine patients appointment rate.
* Alcoholism does did determine patients appointment rate.
* Handicap Status does did determine patients appointment rate.
