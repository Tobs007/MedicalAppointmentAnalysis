# MedicalAppointmentAnalysis

## Dataset

* In this project, I will be investigating the No Show appointments dataset to investigate the factor responsible for the attendance rate of patients. This data was collected from data of over 110k patients who had medical appointments in Brazil. The dataset contains their medical history, appointment schedule, and attendance status for the appointment. The major question I will focus my investigation on is: Which factor(s) amongst the attributes in the dataset makes the patients miss their medical appointment?

* The dataset has 110,527 rows and 14 columns. Dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments)

## Summary of Finding
Based on the investigation conducted, most of the patients attended their medical appointment. The following is the summary conclusion deduced for each answer asked in the introduction.

* Gender does not determine patient's appointment rate.
* SMS receipt status does not determine patients appointment rate, the attendance rate of patients who did not receive SMS was also noticeably higher than that of those that received SMS.
* Hypertension Status does not determine patients appointment rate.
* Diabetes Status does not determine patients appointment rate.
* Alcoholism does not determine patients appointment rate.
* Handicap Status does not determine patients appointment rate.
* Scholarship Status does not determine patients appointment rate.
